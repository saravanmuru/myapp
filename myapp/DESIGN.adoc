== High level requirement analysis

. The client app
  * Reads 1024 bytes from /dev/urandom
  * Cleans out all non UTF-8 compliant chars
  * Replaces all spaces with asterix
  * Sends this data to a server via TCPSocket

. The server app

  * Listens for any connections
  * Accepts the data from the client app
  * Prints it into a log file

=== Architecture

The client app use 'TCPSocket' to communicate with the server app.
The server app use 'GServer' to manage multiple TCP connections on different ports.
